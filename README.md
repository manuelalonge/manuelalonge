# Welcome, my name is Manuel! :wave:

# I am an aspiring freelance web developer. My knowledge is focused on the use of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, React.

## About me

I started programming a couple of years ago, learning the basics of HTML and CSS. Since then I kept on evolving and today I'm following a mentorship program in order to improve my skills, its name is TomorrowDevs. The thing I liked the most about this is the strength of the community and the opportunity to widen my network.

## My experience as a Team Leader :fire:

In TomorrowDevs I experienced how awesome being a Team Leader is :blush:

I am working on a [collaborative project](https://github.com/manuelalonge/team-four-webapp-frontend) which aim is to create a responsive web app that can recognize the subject in the images you load in it. The project is still in progress.

### What did I learn as a Team Leader?

* How to be assertive
* Working with agile methodology
* Working asynchronously and with different timezones
* Writing clear code so that everyone else can understand
* Working with SASS
* Using Webpack

## Which are my most important projects so far? :computer:

* My very first project has been [Trattoria Mangiamo's website](https://bartrattoriamangiamo.000webhostapp.com/), basically a landing page for a restaurant located in my parents' town.
* One of the projects I am most proud of is [IFDA](https://ifdaorientamento.it/)'s landing page. I worked on this together with a [colleague](http://www.coderune.com/) and friend during the first COVID lockdown. IFDA is an Italian fashion schools located in Milan.
* Another project I am proud of is [Calamus Lab](https://www.calamuslab.it/lab/)'s website for which I made many edits. Calamus Lab is a digital copywriting agency.

## Other recent projects :computer:

After starting my adventure in TomorrowDevs, I've been working on challenging projects. Along with the team web app, I created an [hotel landing page](https://github.com/manuelalonge/hotel-landing-page) and I am currently working on a [sports app landing page](https://github.com/manuelalonge/sports-responsive-landing-page).

## Beyond web development :muscle:

I am a very dynamic person and I have many interests. Together with the same friend with whom I created IFDA's web page, I founded [Smart And Working](https://smartandworking.com/), an online shop that sells products that can improve your way to work from home. 

We consider ourselves the smart support for tomorrow's smart working. The website is currently just in italian, however, the shop is opened to everyone :smiley: Visit our shop and find the product that suits your needs the most

Another project I am currently working on is [MindfulStack](https://mindfulstack.medium.com/). MindfulStack's aim is to become a hub for people who want to learn personal growth skills. The project is currently in a testing phase, so you'll be amazed to see how it evolves.
